### Introduction to Lists
- **Data types** define the kind of data a variable can hold (like integers, strings, or booleans)    
- **Data structures** are collections of data values that can be of different types. They provide efficient ways to store, access, and modify data.
- **Lists** are a type of data structure in Python that store ordered collections of items. They are **mutable**, meaning their elements can be changed.
- You can access elements in a list using **indexing** (starting from 0) and create **slices** to extract portions of the list.

### Modify the contents of a list
- append(): Adds an element to the end of a list.
- insert(): Inserts an element at a specific index.
- remove(): Removes a specific element from a list.
